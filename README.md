Initially, I took care of designing the application's framework, i.e. folders, files and components. Then I took care of the most important aspect, which was redux toolkit. I took care of the correct implementation of the library, I wanted the data to be saved in LocalStorage so as not to download contact data every time the application was refreshed. I also took into account possibility for the user to see information about downloading data and occuring errors. When styling, in order to get the task dobe faster, I decided to use MaterialUI. It helped me take care of the visual side of my application.
